Hennepin County MSBA Capstone Project

This repository can be used to build a graph database in Neo4j. 17 csv files are provided in the 2nd_phase_data -> import folder. The way in which you connect the data within the csvs is by executing the import_script found in the 2nd_phase_code folder in the command line of Neo4j browser. 

For those interested, the assumptions made when cleaning all of the raw data are documented in the 2nd_phase_code -> munging folder and the code used to interace with the graph database via the Neo4j terminal, python, and R can be found in the 2nd_phase_code -> demo, exploratory, and predictive folders.

Please, find the final_database_prez.pdf for a summary of this project.
